maintaining health and performance involves more than just balancing the number of weights. In 2025, researchers are focusing on how the structure and relationship between these phases can mimic high-precision models. Here are five advanced suggestions you might not be considering: 1. Phase-Interference Regularization In a phase-coded system, "interference" is your version of weight magnitude. Destructive Interference: If two neurons have weights \(\pi \) radians apart (\(0\) and \(\pi \)), they cancel each other out.Constructive Interference: If they share the same phase, they amplify the signal.Recommendation: Apply a regularization term that prevents too many neurons in a layer from falling into the same phase. This forces the model to use orthogonality (\(\pi /2\) vs \(0\)) rather than simple amplification, which prevents "vanishing gradients" commonly seen in low-bit models. 2. Learnable Phase Thresholds Instead of a fixed mapping where weights round to the nearest phase, allow your thresholds to be trainable parameters. In the early stages of training, you might have wide "catchment areas" for the \(0\) and \(\pi \) phases to establish basic logic.As the model matures, the thresholds can shift to favor the imaginary phases (\(\pi /2,3\pi /2\)) for fine-tuning complex patterns. 3. Layer-Wise "Temperature" Balancing Recent 2025 research suggests that different layers of a model have different optimal "noise" levels. Input Layers: Benefit from a higher "temperature" (more random distribution across all 4 phases) to ensure no input features are ignored.Output Layers: Benefit from a lower temperature, where weights are "frozen" into more stable, frequent phases (primarily \(0\) and \(\pi \)) to provide clear classification signals. 4. Group-Phase Sparsity (Phased Pruning) Instead of pruning individual weights to zero (which you don't have), prune combinations of phases that create "dead zones." If a group of weights effectively sums to a net zero vector (e.g., one weight at \(0\) and one at \(\pi \)), these are "dead" to the network.A healthy model in 2025 should actively re-initialize these "net-zero" groups to new phases to maximize the information density of your 2-bit space. 5. Transition to "Phase-Only" Backpropagation Standard backpropagation assumes a continuous space. For 2025 models, use Discrete Distribution Networks (DDN) techniques. Instead of updating the value of a weight, update the probability that a weight belongs to one of the four phases.This "probabilistic weight fixing" allows the model to explore the discrete 4-phase space more effectively without getting stuck in local minima. Summary Checklist for a "Healthy" Model: Entropy Check: Ensure no single phase exceeds 45% of total weights.Orthogonal Diversity: At least 20% of weights should reside in the "imaginary" phases (\(\pi /2,3\pi /2\)) to allow for non-linear signal rotation.Zero-Mean Activations: The sum of vectors across a layer should trend toward zero to prevent bias shift.
