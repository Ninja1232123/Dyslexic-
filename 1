maintaining health and performance involves more than just balancing the number of weights. In 2025, researchers are focusing on how the structure and relationship between these phases can mimic high-precision models. Here are five advanced suggestions you might not be considering: 1. Phase-Interference Regularization In a phase-coded system, "interference" is your version of weight magnitude. Destructive Interference: If two neurons have weights \(\pi \) radians apart (\(0\) and \(\pi \)), they cancel each other out.Constructive Interference: If they share the same phase, they amplify the signal.Recommendation: Apply a regularization term that prevents too many neurons in a layer from falling into the same phase. This forces the model to use orthogonality (\(\pi /2\) vs \(0\)) rather than simple amplification, which prevents "vanishing gradients" commonly seen in low-bit models. 2. Learnable Phase Thresholds Instead of a fixed mapping where weights round to the nearest phase, allow your thresholds to be trainable parameters. In the early stages of training, you might have wide "catchment areas" for the \(0\) and \(\pi \) phases to establish basic logic.As the model matures, the thresholds can shift to favor the imaginary phases (\(\pi /2,3\pi /2\)) for fine-tuning complex patterns. 3. Layer-Wise "Temperature" Balancing Recent 2025 research suggests that different layers of a model have different optimal "noise" levels. Input Layers: Benefit from a higher "temperature" (more random distribution across all 4 phases) to ensure no input features are ignored.Output Layers: Benefit from a lower temperature, where weights are "frozen" into more stable, frequent phases (primarily \(0\) and \(\pi \)) to provide clear classification signals. 4. Group-Phase Sparsity (Phased Pruning) Instead of pruning individual weights to zero (which you don't have), prune combinations of phases that create "dead zones." If a group of weights effectively sums to a net zero vector (e.g., one weight at \(0\) and one at \(\pi \)), these are "dead" to the network.A healthy model in 2025 should actively re-initialize these "net-zero" groups to new phases to maximize the information density of your 2-bit space. 5. Transition to "Phase-Only" Backpropagation Standard backpropagation assumes a continuous space. For 2025 models, use Discrete Distribution Networks (DDN) techniques. Instead of updating the value of a weight, update the probability that a weight belongs to one of the four phases.This "probabilistic weight fixing" allows the model to explore the discrete 4-phase space more effectively without getting stuck in local minima. Summary Checklist for a "Healthy" Model: Entropy Check: Ensure no single phase exceeds 45% of total weights.Orthogonal Diversity: At least 20% of weights should reside in the "imaginary" phases (\(\pi /2,3\pi /2\)) to allow for non-linear signal rotation.Zero-Mean Activations: The sum of vectors across a layer should trend toward zero to prevent bias shift. 



The Principle of Maximum Entropy (Uniformity) At the very start, the network has no "knowledge." To avoid biasing the model toward specific features or causing "dead" paths, you should aim for a Uniform Phase Distribution. Target: Approximately 25% of weights assigned to each of the four phases (\(0,\pi /2,\pi ,3\pi /2\)).Reason: This maximizes the information capacity of the network. In a discrete space, starting with all weights at \(0\) or \(\pi \) creates a "symmetry problem" where every neuron in a layer computes the same thing, effectively rendering the width of your network useless. 2. Orthogonal Signal Flow Unlike standard models that use small Gaussian values, a 4-phase model relies on rotations. Balance: You must ensure an equal presence of the "imaginary" phases (\(\pi /2\) and \(3\pi /2\)).Function: These phases act as orthogonal bridges. Without them at the start, the network behaves like a simple binary system (+1/-1), losing the ability to represent complex relationships or "interferences" between neurons early on. 3. Layer-Specific Scaling (Pseudo-He/Xavier) Even though your weights are discrete phases, the magnitude of the signal entering each layer still needs to be controlled to prevent vanishing or exploding gradients. Gain Adjustment: Since your phases all have a magnitude of 1, you cannot scale weights individually. Instead, apply a layer-wide initialization gain (\(g\)) based on the number of inputs (\(n\)).Formula: Set \(g=\sqrt{2/n}\) (He-style) or \(g=\sqrt{1/n}\) (Xavier-style) as a multiplier for the entire layer's output. This simulates the "small random values" of traditional models while keeping your internal weights strictly to their four phases. Early Distribution Summary Checklist: Frequency: Each phase should occupy ~25% of the weight matrix.Symmetry: The number of \(0\) phases should roughly equal \(\pi \) phases; the number of \(\pi /2\) should roughly equal \(3\pi /2\).Variance: Use a layer-wide gain factor to ensure the variance of activations remains stable as the signal passes through deep layers.
